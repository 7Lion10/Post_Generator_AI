Then the justification comes - 'Photo daalne se reach milti hai.' Toh bhai flowers daal de, tulips bhi reach denge, why just selfies (in club, on vacation etc) - I'll tell you why - the pictures on fancy vacations, make people feel FOMO - 'How is this person going on vacations every month?' and that's what you need to sell content here. At this point, LinkedIn looks less like a professional network and more like a shaadi.com pre-screening portal. Somewhere between 'personal branding' and 'performative posting', we forgot that this platform was built for perspective, not posing. Maybe because it's easier to upload a face than to build a voice. 'Kya ho jaayega, kya mil jaayega?' Validation. A few likes, a few 'great share!' comments - and a temporary illusion of relevance. The goal was to be seen for your work, not liked for your lighting. Remember: if your selfie is the only thing adding value, maybe the content was never the problem. likesupportlove",

We light diyas outside, but forget to light one within. Maybe Diwali isn\u2019t about more lights. Maybe it\u2019s about less darkness. This year - Let\u2019s forgive someone who never said sorry. Let\u2019s message that friend who disappeared. Let\u2019s feed someone who can\u2019t celebrate. And let\u2019s be grateful - for everything we once prayed for. Because true Diwali isn\u2019t the sparkle of fireworks - It\u2019s the peace that comes when you stop competing, comparing, and complaining. So here\u2019s to a festival full of quiet hearts, kind words, and warm hugs. Happy Diwali to everyone who\u2019s healing, rebuilding, and trying again likelovesupport",

It\u2019s a part of it. This day started in Finland, to remind the world that behind every 'overnight success' are hundreds of 'not-this-time' moments. Every time you were rejected. Every time your idea was laughed at. Every time you felt like you weren\u2019t enough. That was training. Not tragedy. Because failure teaches what success hides - humility, resilience, patience, and hunger. So if you\u2019re reading this and feel like you\u2019re falling behind - Remember, you\u2019re just in your learning chapter. Every successful person has one. Today, don\u2019t hide your failures. Share them. Own them. Celebrate them. Because the more you normalize failure, the easier it becomes to try again. Happy International Day for Failure Here\u2019s to those who tried, fell, and still got up again. likeloveinsightful",

So if life feels stuck right now - breathe. You\u2019re not behind. You\u2019re being prepared. Sometimes the universe slows you down because your timing needs to match your blessing. Keep moving.

If you want to earn a million, first learn to manage a hundred. Not for the money - but for the discipline. Momentum is quiet. But it compounds like interest. One small win creates another. And one consistent act becomes identity. In the end, greatness is never achieved in leaps - only in inches, repeated daily. Start small. Stay consistent.
