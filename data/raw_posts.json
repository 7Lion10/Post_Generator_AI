    "text": "Why do people post selfies on LinkedIn? Like seriously- what are you trying to achieve? Kya ho jaayega, kya mil jaayega? Then the justification comes - 'Photo daalne se reach milti hai.' Toh bhai flowers daal de, tulips bhi reach denge, why just selfies (in club, on vacation etc) - I'll tell you why - the pictures on fancy vacations, make people feel FOMO - 'How is this person going on vacations every month?' and that's what you need to sell content here. At this point, LinkedIn looks less like a professional network and more like a shaadi.com pre-screening portal. Somewhere between 'personal branding' and 'performative posting', we forgot that this platform was built for perspective, not posing. Maybe because it's easier to upload a face than to build a voice. 'Kya ho jaayega, kya mil jaayega?' Validation. A few likes, a few 'great share!' comments - and a temporary illusion of relevance. The goal was to be seen for your work, not liked for your lighting. Remember: if your selfie is the only thing adding value, maybe the content was never the problem. likesupportlove",

We light diyas outside, but forget to light one within. Maybe Diwali isn’t about more lights. Maybe it’s about less darkness. This year - Let’s forgive someone who never said sorry. Let’s message that friend who disappeared. Let’s feed someone who can’t celebrate. And let’s be grateful - for everything we once prayed for. Because true Diwali isn’t the sparkle of fireworks - It’s the peace that comes when you stop competing, comparing, and complaining. So here’s to a festival full of quiet hearts, kind words, and warm hugs. Happy Diwali to everyone who’s healing, rebuilding, and trying again likelovesupport",

    "text": "If someone still believes things can get better, don’t take that hope away. Maybe that’s all they have left. Maybe that’s what’s keeping them alive. This world doesn’t need more critics - it needs more kindness. More people who say, 'It’s okay, try again.' More people who don’t make fun of others for still believing. Because sometimes, hope isn’t delusion. It’s medicine. So next time someone says they’re 'trying again,' don’t roll your eyes. Smile. You might have just given them a reason to keep going likelovesupport",

    "text": "Being a Product Manager is not just about data, dashboards, or documents. It’s about confidence. Confidence to say no when ten people are saying yes. Confidence to speak in a room full of engineers, even when you don’t code. Confidence to defend your user - not your ego. Confidence to admit 'I don’t know' and still lead the discussion. Confidence to take ownership when things go wrong. Because here’s the truth - A PM without confidence becomes a note-taker. A PM with confidence becomes a decision-maker. The roadmap is important. The metrics are important. But your voice? That’s your real product. likeinsightfullove",

We say 'salary is decent,' but the rent, EMIs, Swiggy bills, and 'shaadi ka gift' say otherwise. We don’t buy brands for status - we buy them on Big Billion Day. Still, we show up. Still, we hustle. Still, we smile. Because somewhere deep down, we know - we’re the ones who’ll build something out of nothing. That’s what middle class people do - we make dreams look affordable. likelovesupport",

    "text": "13th October 2025 - International Day of Failure. Sounds strange, right? A day to celebrate failure? But here’s the truth - Failure isn’t the opposite of success. It’s a part of it. This day started in Finland, to remind the world that behind every 'overnight success' are hundreds of 'not-this-time' moments. Every time you were rejected. Every time your idea was laughed at. Every time you felt like you weren’t enough. That was training. Not tragedy. Because failure teaches what success hides - humility, resilience, patience, and hunger. So if you’re reading this and feel like you’re falling behind - Remember, you’re just in your learning chapter. Every successful person has one. Today, don’t hide your failures. Share them. Own them. Celebrate them. Because the more you normalize failure, the easier it becomes to try again. Happy International Day for Failure Here’s to those who tried, fell, and still got up again. likeloveinsightful",

    "text": "One day, it’ll all make sense. Why that job didn’t work out. Why that person left. Why you had to start all over again. You’ll look back and realize - nothing was random. Every delay, every rejection, every detour was quietly redirecting you towards something better. You just couldn’t see it yet. So if life feels stuck right now - breathe. You’re not behind. You’re being prepared. Sometimes the universe slows you down because your timing needs to match your blessing. Keep moving. Even when it’s slow. Even when it’s silent. Because one day, you’ll look back and whisper - 'It was all leading me here.' likelovesupport",

    "text": "I used to think the biggest risk in life was failing. But I learned the real risk is never trying. Most people wait for the 'perfect time.' Perfect skills. Perfect plan. Perfect confidence. Truth? None of that exists. You build it on the way, not before you start. Every person you admire today once felt unready. They just didn’t let that stop them. Start the YouTube channel. Apply for that job. Ask for that promotion. Launch that side hustle. Post that idea. You’ll be bad before you’re good. You’ll be scared before you’re confident. But one day, you’ll look back and realize - this messy, uncertain beginning… was the best part. If this hit you even a little - it’s your sign to stop waiting and start building. Because the world doesn’t need a perfect you. It needs a real you - in progress, trying anyway. likeloveinsightful",

    "text": "You don’t have to prove your worth to exist. In this world, everyone is busy performing - performing success, ambition, happiness. We work late not because we must, but because we fear what 'leaving early' might say about us. We post achievements not to celebrate, but to convince ourselves we’re not falling behind. Somewhere along the way, we forgot that existing is not a competition. The tree doesn’t rush to bloom. The ocean doesn’t apologize for being still. Why must you? Your worth is not measured by your output, your title, or your LinkedIn activity. It’s measured by your peace. By how gently you treat yourself when no one’s watching. So slow down.

No updates. Just… algorithms deciding my worth. Truth is - job hunting today isn’t a talent test. It’s a patience test. What I want you to remember - You can have the skills. You can have the experience. But if your résumé doesn’t 'pass the system,' you don’t even get seen. To everyone feeling invisible right now - you are not the problem. The system is. And it desperately needs fixing. Let’s build a world where applications get human responses, not AI rejection letters. Where effort gets respect, not silence. likesupportcelebrate",

    "text": "Start small. But start. Wake up five minutes earlier. Write one sentence. Read one page. Do one push-up. The size of the step never mattered - only the direction did. People wait for the 'right time.' The wise know time becomes right only after they begin. You don’t build success overnight. You build the habit of showing up - and success follows. If you want to earn a million, first learn to manage a hundred. Not for the money - but for the discipline. Momentum is quiet. But it compounds like interest. One small win creates another. And one consistent act becomes identity. In the end, greatness is never achieved in leaps - only in inches, repeated daily. Start small. Stay consistent.

    "text": "Why you should date a Product Manager Dating a PM is like dating someone who: We’ll plan your dates like sprint retros - 'What went well? What didn’t? What’s the action item?' Never forgets anniversaries - there’s a reminder, dependency, and escalation plan for that. Knows when to stop arguing - they’ve already done a root cause analysis of your fight. We can’t handle surprises - unless they come with a PRD. Can handle your mood swings - because they’ve survived 5 stakeholder conflicts in one week. Believes in constant iteration - on themselves, the relationship, and the playlist. And when they say 'Let’s align on expectations', they actually mean it. Sure, we overthink, overplan, and over-document - but we’ll never under-love. So yeah… date a PM. We might not fix the world, but we’ll definitely optimize yours.
